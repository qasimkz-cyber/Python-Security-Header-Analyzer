# Python Security Header Analyzer üõ°Ô∏è

A command-line tool built in Python to analyze the HTTP security headers of a given URL. This script helps assess a website's security posture by checking for key headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) that are crucial for defending against common web vulnerabilities.

## Features
* Analyzes any given URL for the presence of important security headers.
* Provides clear, color-coded output for found (‚úÖ Green) and missing (‚ùå Red) headers.
* Handles connection errors and bad server responses gracefully.
* Accepts the target URL as a simple command-line argument.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x

## Setup & Installation

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-Security-Header-Analyzer
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

Examples
Analyzing a secure site:

Bash

$ python analyzer.py [https://github.com](https://github.com)

‚úÖ Success! Connected to [https://github.com](https://github.com) (Status Code: 200)

‚úÖ [FOUND]   Content-Security-Policy
‚úÖ [FOUND]   Strict-Transport-Security

--- Summary ---
‚úÖ Secure: All critical security headers were found.
Analyzing a less secure site:

Bash

$ python analyzer.py [http://example.com](http://example.com)

‚úÖ Success! Connected to [http://example.com](http://example.com) (Status Code: 200)
